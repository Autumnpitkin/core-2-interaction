        <div class="page"><h3>Shanann and the Girls Disappear</h3>
        <p>August 13, 2018:
            <br>
            <br> Shanann and the girls were last seen on Monday, Aug. 13, 2018. Chris Watts gave a series of stilted television interviews after their disappearance, pleading for their safe return. "We had an emotional conversation," he told Denver 7, a day after his family was reported missing. "She wasn't here. The kids weren't here. Nobody was here."</p></div>
          <div class="page"><h3>Chris Watts’ Truck Evidence</h3>
        <p>Chris Watts' truck, a 2015 Ford F-250, played a critical role in the investigation. A neighbor’s security camera captured Chris Watts backing his truck into the driveway at 5:27 AM on August 13, 2018—which was unusual, as he normally parked on the street. The footage showed Watts making multiple trips to and from the garage, appearing to load items into the truck.</p></div>
          <div class="page"><h3>Forensic Evidence in the Truck</h3>
        <p>Cadaver dogs were brought in to search Chris' truck and showed interest in the back seat. The rear seats of the truck had been stripped of their original covers, indicating a possible attempt to remove forensic evidence.</p></div>
          <div class="page"><h3>GPS Data & Cell Phone Records</h3>
        <p>Chris’ truck had a GPS tracking system from his employer, Anadarko Petroleum. The data showed that he left his home at 5:37 AM and drove straight to Cervi 319, an oil field where the bodies were later found.
            His cell phone records indicated that he called Nichol Kessinger, his mistress, later that morning and behaved as if nothing was wrong.</p></div>
          <div class="page"><h3>The House Investigation</h3>
        <p>No signs of forced entry were found in the Watts' home, ruling out a break-in.
            Shanann’s purse, phone, wedding ring, and car (with the girls’ car seats still inside) were all left at home.</p></div>
        <div class="page"><h3>Unusual Behavior</h3>
        <p>He gave TV interviews, pleading for his family’s return, but his lack of emotion raised suspicions. Instead of showing visible distress or urgency, he appeared calm, detached, and unemotional. Chris referred to his daughters and Shanann in past tense, a common subconscious slip seen in guilty individuals. Example: "She was a fantastic mom." (Instead of "is" a fantastic mom). His tone was flat and emotionless, and he did not shed any tears.
            He crossed his arms defensively and rocked back and forth, a sign of discomfort.
