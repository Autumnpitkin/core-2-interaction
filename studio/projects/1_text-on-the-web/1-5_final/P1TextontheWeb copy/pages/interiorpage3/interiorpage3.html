                <p>While in police custody, Chris claimed that he told Shanann that he wanted to separate. He alleged that he went downstairs and noticed Shanann strangling C.W. — and that B.W.'s lifeless body was nearby. He ran upstairs in a "rage," he claimed and strangled Shanann. Cops didn't believe his story. "His story didn't match the evidence that we had," a police source told PEOPLE at the time.</p>

                    On March 7, 2019, a video of Chris Watts' full confession — which he'd provided to investigators in February 
                    — was made public. In the video, he told investigators from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation that 
                    on the night of the murders, he'd jumped on Shanann in bed after he'd told her he didn't love 
                    her anymore. He claims she threatened to leave him and take the children. Then Watts drove 45 
                    minutes to a remote oil field, with Shanann's corpse in the bed of the truck and his still-living 
                    girls in the backseat. Before burying Shanann in a shallow grave, Watts said he smothered C.W. 
                    in the backseat. After dumping C.W.'s body in an old field, he returned to smother B.W., who 
                    begged for her life. As he went to kill her, B.W. screamed, "Daddy, No!" and "it was the last words 
                    she spoke," the report reads.
